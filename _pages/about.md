# Bio
I am now teaching the graduate course of “Distributed System” as well as the undergraduate course of “Operating System”. My research interests include computer architecture and distributed systems. Recently, my group focuses on AI for system and system for AI research. I received my master and Ph.D degrees from Tsinghua University advised by [Prof. Weimin Zheng](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1137/3889.htm) and [Prof. Wenguang Chen](https://pacman.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~cwg/).
