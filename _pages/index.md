# Bio

I am currently teaching the graduate course “Distributed Systems” and the undergraduate course “Operating Systems”. My research interests span computer architecture and distributed systems, with a focus on graph computing, graph databases, and vector indexing. Recently, my group has been exploring both AI for systems and systems for AI. Our research outcomes have been integrated into products or deployed in production environments at leading companies such as [Ant Group](https://www.antgroup.com/), [DiDi Global](https://www.didiglobal.com/) and [Stargraph](https://www.stargraph.cn/).

I received my master's and Ph.D. degrees from Tsinghua University, advised by [Prof. Weimin Zheng](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1137/3889.htm) and [Prof. Wenguang Chen](https://pacman.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~cwg/).
